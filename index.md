# Welcome to CJ's Dataman Project

The **Dataman Project** is a personal coding challenge I've taken on to help people improve their math skills in a fun and interactive way. It's built using Python and Flask, with a focus on delivering quick feedback and offering engaging challenges. 

## What Can You Do with Dataman?

- **Answer Checker Mode**: Never be left in doubt! Enter your answers, and Dataman will immediately tell you if you're right or wrong, while also providing tips to help you learn from your mistakes.
  
- **Memory Bank**: Stuck on a tough problem? Dataman lets you store any challenging questions for later review, so you can keep improving at your own pace.

- **Number Guesser**: Want a fun game? The Number Guesser mode challenges you to think fast and guess numbers with as few tries as possible—perfect for testing your number intuition.

## Why I Built This Project

I’m Carl "CJ" Williams, and this project is part of my coursework for CTS 285. The Dataman Project reflects my passion for combining learning with interactive tools. I designed this program to not only serve as a math helper but to make math more enjoyable through positive reinforcement.

This project has been a great opportunity for me to practice my programming skills while building something that can genuinely help users. I’m also using GitHub for version control, which helps keep my code organized and allows for easy collaboration if needed.



## What’s Next?

I plan to add even more features to Dataman in the future. Stay tuned for:
- **Login System**: Personalize your Dataman experience by logging in and tracking your progress.
- **New Modes**: More math games and challenge modes are on the way.
