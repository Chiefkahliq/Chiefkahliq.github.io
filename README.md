# Dataman Project (Sprint 2)

## Overview
This project is part of the **Dataman Sprint 2** assignment. It includes several key features like **Answer Checker**, **Memory Bank**, **Login System**, **Number Guesser**, and a **Power-Saver Feature**. The goal is to create an interactive learning tool where parents or teachers can add custom problems for students to solve and give feedback based on the student's responses.

## Features
### 1. Login System
- The program starts with a login screen, where a parent or teacher can log in using predefined credentials.
- **Username**: `teacher`
- **Password**: `password123`
- Only authorized users can access the rest of the program, including adding problems to the Memory Bank.

### 2. Answer Checker
- The program asks a predefined question: "What is the answer to life, the universe, and everything?"
- The user has 3 attempts to answer correctly.
- If the user answers correctly, motivational feedback is provided.
- If the user answers incorrectly after 3 attempts, they are encouraged to try again next time.

### 3. Memory Bank
- After completing the Answer Checker, the user can add custom problems to a Memory Bank.
- The user can continue adding problems until they type "done."
- The program then displays all the problems saved in the Memory Bank.

### 4. Number Guesser
- The user plays a number guessing game, where they need to guess a random number between 1 and 100.
- The user has up to 5 attempts to guess correctly, with feedback provided for each attempt.

### 5. Power-Saver Feature
- After completing all the activities, the program will automatically shut down after a 5-second delay to simulate a power-saving feature.

## How to Run the Program
1. Open the project in **Visual Studio**.
2. Run the program by pressing **F5** or clicking **Start**.
3. Follow the instructions in the console to log in and interact with the different features.

- **As a student**, I want to retrieve saved problems from the Memory Bank to practice and improve my skills.

### 4. Number Guesser
